            <h2>Good day!</h2>
            <p>
                I am a fresh graduate with 6 months experience in the Game Development Industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being a Game Developer allows me to enjoy solving, analyzing, and creating complex game mechanics
                that makes the game function. I also enjoy talking about programming concepts and best practices when
                it comes to Game Development as this helps me gain knowledge that I can apply to different mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be a Game Developer is my passion and my dream job as someone who also plays video games.
