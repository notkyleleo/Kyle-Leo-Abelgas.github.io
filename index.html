        <h2>Good day!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a fresh graduate with 6 months experience in the Game Development Industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being a Game Developer allows me to enjoy solving, analyzing, and creating complex game mechanics
            that makes the game function. I also enjoy talking about programming concepts and best practices when
            it comes to Game Development as this helps me gain knowledge that I can apply to different mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be a Game Developer is my passion and my dream job as someone who also plays video games.
